WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic President Barack Obama will take a swipe at austerity-minded Republicans on Friday ahead of a looming budget rematch, urging against the backdrop of a model school that spending, rather than belt-tightening, is key to economic growth.

Lawmakers are girding for a conference starting Wednesday aimed at reconciling vastly different spending plans put forward by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives.

Obama will use a speech at the Pathways in Technology Early College High School in Brooklyn, New York, whose technology curriculum he has praised as a beacon for the future, to contrast his budget priorities with Republicans.

"The president believes that the upcoming budget conference is an opportunity for Washington to focus on building a strong, secure middle class," a White House official said. "The president will continue to insist that Congress invest in our economy and create good jobs with good wages because we can't just cut our way to prosperity."

The president's renewed focus on the budget comes just over a week after the end of a stalemate that resulted in a 16-day government shutdown and a near U.S. debt default. Since then, Obama has been back on the defensive over the seriously flawed online gateway to health insurance that is central to his signature health care law, often called Obamacare.

White House aides say the president is looking ahead to the next round of the budget debate and wants to use the speech to contrast his goals of boosting government spending on things like schools and infrastructure with those of Republicans, who are focused on reining in the nation's debt and deficit and shrinking the role of government.

Obama is due to remind the audience that the deficit is projected to shrink this year to about half of what it was in 2009. He will say he is open to further deficit reduction, and to trimming benefits to be paid out over the long term under Social Security and Medicare, but only if they are accompanied by ending tax breaks and increasing revenues to the government.

Those lofty goals contrast with the more modest expectations expressed by some lawmakers taking part in the budget negotiations.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said on Thursday a new round of budget negotiations starting next week should focus more narrowly on replacing automatic spending cuts rather than an elusive "grand bargain." Ryan will lead Republicans on the 29-member panel that is trying to reach a deal before December 15.

Both parties want to minimize the impact of the across-the-board sequester cuts that went into effect in March and avoid a further $109 billion round of reductions due to bite on January 15.

Obama is due to speak at the high school and then take part in two fundraisers, one for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which aims to get Democrats elected in the House, and the other for the Democratic National Committee, which coordinates Democratic party activity.

The Pathways in Technology high school earned praise from the president during his State of the Union speech earlier this year for a six-year program that allows students to earn a community college degree as well as a chance to work with the partner company of the school, IBM.

The school, which also collaborates with the City University of New York, allows students to get an associate of arts degree in computers or engineering.

Obama praised the school as a model for efforts to compete with the education systems of countries like Germany, which he said was preparing students for technical jobs immediately after high school.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new round of U.S. budget negotiations starting next week should focus more narrowly on replacing automatic spending cuts rather than an elusive "grand bargain," House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said on Thursday.

Ryan told Reuters in an interview that simply maintaining the automatic "sequester" cuts was the fallback position for Republicans if Democrats do not agree to substitute longer-term savings on expensive federal benefits programs.

"We have spending cuts coming. The question is, can we get something that's better than this?" said Ryan, last year's Republican vice presidential nominee. "If we can get an agreement, it's obviously going to be better than the status quo."

He said reducing expectations could make the talks more successful than past efforts, such as the 2011 "supercommittee" that failed to find $1.2 trillion in savings over 10 years.

"My hope is that it has a better chance because we'll set more rational expectations of what we're setting out to achieve," Ryan said.

"If we focused on doing some big grand bargain, like those prior efforts ... then I don't think we'll be successful because we'll focus on our differences. Each party will demand that the other compromises a core principle and then we'll get nothing done," he said.

The 29-member negotiating committee, set in motion by last week's deal to end a government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit, will convene on Wednesday.

Ryan, who will lead Republicans on the panel, said there was a better chance of finding common ground with Democrats on "smarter" spending cuts to replace the across-the-board reductions to discretionary spending. He said those include reforms to "entitlements," which include the Medicare and Social Security programs for the elderly, Medicaid healthcare for the poor and some farm subsidy programs.

He noted that President Barack Obama had proposed changes to those programs, such as a lower inflation gauge for the Social Security retirement program's cost-of-living increases. His Democratic counterpart, Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, also has proposed some ways to reduce healthcare costs by $275 billion over 10 years through new efficiencies.

Both parties want to mitigate the sequester's impact, especially with a further $109 billion round of cuts due to launch on January 15 - the same date that government agency funding runs out again. Military programs favored by Republicans would bear more than half of those cuts.

REVENUE STICKING POINT

Ryan reiterated his long-standing opposition to further tax revenue increases as part of the budget negotiations, saying a major tax hike for the wealthiest Americans in January was already hurting the economy.

"If people see this conference as an excuse to raise taxes, I don't think it's going to be successful," Ryan said.

Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen, another member of the budget panel, told Reuters on Tuesday that Democrats would not agree to significant cuts in social programs without increasing revenues by eliminating some tax breaks.

Without that, they will not consider proposals such as the cost-of-living change or charging wealthier seniors more for their Medicare health coverage, Van Hollen said.

If the two sides remain at loggerheads over revenues and benefits cuts, Ryan said the sequester cuts would simply remain in place, hitting agencies and programs ranging from education to military readiness.

"It's not our preferred route to reducing deficit and spending, but it works," he said, adding that Republicans were "proud" of the fact it had produced tangible savings.

"If we can't replace these spending cuts with smarter spending cuts, then we'll take what we have," he said.

He also said he believed the panel could help ease some sequester pain on federal agencies and the military by offering them more flexibility to spend their reduced budgets more effectively.

He also would like the panel to discuss ways to support comprehensive tax reform, which he views as a revenue-neutral endeavor that jolts economic growth by closing tax breaks, reducing rates and simplifying a complex tax code.

The negotiating panel is due to issue a recommendation by December 13, requiring majority approval among panelists from each chamber - seven House of Representatives members and 22 Senate members. The January 15 expiration of government funding creates the threat of another government shutdown if the two sides cannot come to some agreement.

Ryan said he was not interested in threatening another shutdown, adding, "I'd rather focus on the here and the now rather than January 15."

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering relaxing the foreign investment limit in TV and radio stations as part of its review of broadcast ownership rules.

Under the current rules, there is a 25 percent cap on any foreign investment in a U.S. broadcast holding company. The FCC will discuss the agenda at its next open meeting on November 14.

"Approval of this item will clarify the commission's intention to review, on a case-by-case basis, proposed transactions that would exceed the 25 percent benchmark that restricts foreign ownership in companies holding broadcast licenses," FCC Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said in a notification posted on the agency's website.

The FCC postponed its vote in February on new media-ownership rules until an outside study of an impact on minority broadcasters was complete.

On Thursday, the FCC said it will conduct a study on the Hispanic television landscape in the United States.

FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said he is optimistic that the agency will eliminate the foreign ownership restrictions.

"Under our rules, a foreign company can indirectly hold more than a one-quarter stake in our nation's largest wireless carriers, cable operators, cable programmers, and Internet backbone providers. Yet that company cannot own a similar interest in a single radio station in rural Kansas," Pai said.

Pai added that the "disparity makes no sense, especially considering the difficult financial circumstances facing many broadcasters."

The National Association of Broadcasters said on Thursday it welcomed the FCC move to consider foreign investment in U.S. broadcast companies the same way it considers such investments in other telecommunications properties.

"Permitting new potential sources of capital for American radio and TV stations will strengthen our ability to continue providing compelling news, entertainment and sports programming and to remain competitive in a multi-channel digital world," NAB said.
